What an honor! One of my lectures (the one I gave in Oslo last year) has been featured in ChomskyTorrents. For those of you who may not know:

<a target="_blank" title="Chomsky Torrents" href="https://www.chomskytorrents.org">ChomskyTorrents</a>: a gathering place for torrents with progressive and radical content. As for now, it preserves a special place for the work of American dissident Noam Chomsky, as the domain name suggests.
