[Here](http://www.cortell.net/selfness/intro/) you have the long awaited &#8220;Selfness: a world without copyright&#8221; Intro (in English, since it will be easier to find someone to translate it from English to Spanish than from Spanish to English).

I would like, indeed I need, you to contribute your comments, corrections, etc. Besides, structure suggestions are welcome. I would like it to be a collaborative book. So add your comments here as you read along (in the page header I will put the update date).

Thank you and I hope you enjoy it.
