**Thank you very much** to the thousands of people who have showed me their support from all over the world (USA, Argentina, Puerto Rico, Germany, UK, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Greece, Ireland, Brazil, Finland, Denmark, Italy, France&#8230;) through emails, comments and blog trackbacks. As much as I would love to, it is going to be absolutely impossible to reply to you all, but I want to thank you because it is important (for me and for others who may be in a similar situation) to know that I am not alone.

What I have noticed in many of those messages is that it would be good for an open (and much needed debate) regarding this issue that I delivered this conference in English, well recorded (video and audio), and released through P2P for everyone to find out and share it.

So, following the &#8220;invitations&#8221; offered by Courtney Glosser, Ben Snyder, and several others (although they forgot to post their email, so I can not reply directly to them), I would like to announce that **I am willing to go to anywhere in the world and speak to anyone who is willing to hear the conference and / or debate &#8220;The legal use and benefits of the P2P networks, even when dealing with copyrighted works&#8221;, or my first hand experience with subtle censorship and pressure.**

So anyone, from any university, corporation, or group, in any country, interested in having me speak or lecture, feel free to **contact me directly by email: jorge (at) cortell (dot) net.** _The only non-negotiable condition being that the lectures / speeches will be **shared freely** through P2P networks, and anyone will be able to do anything with it (including translation, derivative works, selling &#8220;hard copies&#8221;, broadcasting, etc) without the need to ask for permission. Just as anyone has always been able to do with any of my &#8220;works&#8221;._
