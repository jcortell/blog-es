[Hurricane Katrina](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17017) has arrived in the US, and it has caused [destruction](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17018).
  
As much as I criticise the US (specially the Bush Administration, and some of their &#8220;values&#8221;), I also love many things about that country, and have many friends there.
  
My heart and thoughts are with you.
