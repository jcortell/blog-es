The Wimbledon Tennis Tournament is here again, one more year. I can see it from my living-room window.   

<!--more-->

Like every year, the tournament means:
 
* I can watch the tennis pros practice and warm up in my back yard, as I live in the castle right in front of the Wimbledon practice courts
* Every shop window in town is decorated with tennis themes, even cupcakes are tennis-themed
* Green, purple, and white everywhere
* People, people, and more people. On the streets, in the subway, in stores, lining (cueing) up...
* Police and security
* Sponsoring brands and events
* Our neighbors throwing Wimbledon Tennis parties. Some of them quite elaborate (with tents, catering, string quartets...)
* Luxury cars illegally parked nearby, with chauffeurs waiting for their customers (ITF, players, bankers, etc) to come out of the game
* Tennis stars, celebrities, paparazzo and fans, running to or away from each other
