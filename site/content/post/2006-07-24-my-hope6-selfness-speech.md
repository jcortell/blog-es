[Update: <a target="_blank" title="Selfness HOPE6 talk" href="https://www.archive.org/details/Hope6_Selfness">here is the video</a>]

First of all, thank you very much for coming to <strike>my</strike> our speech, or for coming to this blog to see what it was about.

<a target="_blank" title="Hope6 Selfless PDF presentation" href="https://homepage.mac.com/jorgecortell/docs/hope6.pdf">Here</a> you have the PDF file of the speech (and <a title="Online DVD ordering" target="_blank" href="https://ncrsusa.com/">here</a> is the site where you can buy the DVD of any speech given during HOPE6). Keep in mind that given the time limit, I had to leave out many interesting things and sources. You will find these in <a target="_blank" title="Previosu lectures" href="https://www.cortell.net/conferencias-anteriores/">previous lectures</a> (look for the ones I have given in English: Harvard, Stanford, Oslo, or Oxford).

<a target="_blank" title="Free culture works" href="https://www.cortell.net/regala-libertad-obras-libres-yo-gratis/">Here</a> is the link of the page where I list websites with freely downloadable (and legally even in the USA) music, movies, etc.

<a target="_blank" title="my English posts" href="https://www.cortell.net/category/english/">Here</a> is the link to the articles Iâ€˜ve written in English.

And <a target="_blank" title="Selfness book" href="https://www.cortell.net/selfness/">here</a> is the link to the Selfness book Iâ€˜m writting (I did not mention it in the speech, because I did not want it to turn it into a "self-promotion" speech).

And more importantly: thank you again. I really hope you enjoyed it.

<a title="contact Jorge" target="_blank" href="https://www.cortell.net/en-about-jorge/contact/">Keep in touch</a>, keep fighting, and most importantly: keep hacking ðŸ˜‰
