A psychological trap. We all, at some point, to some extent, fall into it.

In one hand we have the expectations others have of us. Wether real or imagined. Your son, your dad, your coworker, your lover, your friend... They push us, inspire us, but ultimately can crush us. The more responsible you are, the bigger the weight (real or perceived, which is just about the same for that matter) of those expectations.

You can try the "non responsible approach". Being careless is often a way of avoiding the unbearable weight of expectations. But as you become careless to avoid others‘ expectations, you become less and less reliable, ultimately failing yourself.

And that is where the biggest trap of all is found: your own expectations, your need to fit in, your wish to accomplish your goals, your desire to be liked... it is all a big and mean machine putting more and more pressure on you.

Is there a way out? No (the "non responsible approach" should not be an option).

Is there a way through? Yes: being down-to-earth with your goals, sincere with the people surrounding you. That is the "realistic approach".

Is there any other way? Of course. There is always a way: dream, hope, fly... and forgive yourself if you fall, love others even if they feel deceived by you. Live.
