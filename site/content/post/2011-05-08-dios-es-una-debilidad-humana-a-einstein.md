En una [deliciosa carta](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2009/10/word-god-is-product-of-human-weakness.html), Einstein dice:

> The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weakness, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still purely primitive, legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this. ... For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstition. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong ... have no different quality for me than all other people. As far as my experience goes, they are also no better than other human groups, although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power. Otherwise I cannot see anything “chosen” about them.

Y también:

> **But a limited causality is no longer a causality at all, as our wonderful Spinoza recognized with all incision...**

Dedicado a todos los religiosos y deterministas que gravitan entorno no a una masa, sino a un poder.
