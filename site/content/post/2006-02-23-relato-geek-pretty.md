Hace unos dí­as alguien me propuso que participase en un premio de literatura breve sobre tecnologí­a (&#8220;cuentos geeks&#8221;). Me encantan los premios, pero no me gusta escribir para un panel de jueces, o para recibir un premio. Si me lo han de dar, estaré encantado, pero si lo escribo es para que lo lea todo el mundo. O nadie. O yo, que es lo mismo. Así­ que aquí­ va uno de los que tengo preparados, esperando alguna buena excusa para revisarlo y publicarlo (siento que esté en inglés, pero así­ querí­a este relato ser escrito).

Geek pretty

&#8211; The candles lit on the table, the fire burning in the fireplace, the streetlights flickering through the window&#8230; &#8211; she said &#8211; it&#8217;s so pretty.

(The router&#8217;s leds on and off, Tivo&#8217;s light glowing, the PowerBook&#8217;s status light pulsing&#8230; THAT&#8217;s pretty) &#8211; he thought to himself.

&#8211; Of course it&#8217;s beautiful, baby. I&#8217;ll be right there as soon as I finish this blog post. Why don&#8217;t you start the movie? &#8211; he said, assuming that she would not understand where he found beauty.

&#8211; Sweetheart, some day you are going to get arrested. Be careful with what you write, ok?

As soon as he finished, he joined her on the couch. The movie had started a few minutes ago, but he had seen it before (downloaded it from Pando P2P and watched on a flight on his iPod video). They hugged and kissed, like they always did when they were close to each other, and she said:

&#8211; Geek pretty, that&#8217;s what it is.

&#8211; What?

&#8211; The flickering lights from all that equipment. You thought I would not notice, didn&#8217;t you?

&#8211; You are incredible.

&#8211; No, you are.

&#8211; You know what&#8217;s the most beautiful light of them all?

&#8211; Tell me.

&#8211; The light shining in your eyes, when you look at me. The light that will save my soul.

And they kissed in a way that you can&#8217;t do online.
