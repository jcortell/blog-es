Los chicos de DefectiveByDesign.org me enví­an esta nota de prensa:

Press release from DefectiveByDesign.org:

_This is a big week for anti-DRM activists in the UK (and around the world). The <a target="_blank" title="British government" href="http://defectivebydesign.org/sites/nodrm.civicactions.net/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?q=148824&u=316">British government has rejected a petition</a> from UK residents to ban DRM. Their response was preposterous in its naivety. The government suggests that DRM adds value for the customer! At the same time, the <a target="_blank" title="BBC open consultation" href="http://defectivebydesign.org/sites/nodrm.civicactions.net/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?q=148824&u=317">BBC has opened a Public Consultation</a> asking constituents to <a target="_blank" title="weigh in" href="http://defectivebydesign.org/sites/nodrm.civicactions.net/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?q=148824&u=318">weigh in</a> on their proposal to add DRM to BBC content and on-demand services. Anyone can participate on their website. You can visit <a target="_blank" title="Site" href="http://defectivebydesign.org/sites/nodrm.civicactions.net/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?q=148824&u=317">our site</a> for some resources on the issue. The <a target="_blank" title="Financial Times poll" href="http://defectivebydesign.org/sites/nodrm.civicactions.net/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?q=148824&u=319">Financial Times is running a poll</a> on their website asking **&#8220;Should music companies drop DRM?&#8221;** The responses so far are overwhelmingly on the side of dropping DRM as are comments on the poll. You can <a target="_blank" title="Vote and comment" href="http://defectivebydesign.org/sites/nodrm.civicactions.net/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?q=148824&u=320;s=646099322&f=890094803&m=2261003441&r=2261003441">vote, and comment at the Financial Times website</a>.- _
