  Goodbye<br /> Hasn‘t been so good to me<br /> Stepped out into the night<br /> Back against the moon<br /> I saw ten thousand hands with candlelight<br /> We all think that we‘re right<br /> It‘s hard to tell<br /> If the night is full of hope or doom
</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
  What more than sorry can i say<br /> What more than sorry can i be<br /> Before our love fades away<br /> What more than sorry<br /> Do you want from me
</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
  My eyes<br /> Burn with unshed tears<br /> My body is weak<br /> From so many silent years<br /> Too many people say goodbye<br /> Before they say hello<br /> Step into the morning<br /> And disappear
</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
  What more than sorry can i say<br /> What more than sorry can i be<br /> Before our love fades away<br /> What more than sorry<br /> Do you want from me
