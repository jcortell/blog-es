Favorite subway station to hear street musicians jamming away: Union Square (just saw HetandJef, and then <a target="_blank" title="Natalia Paruz" href="https://www.sawlady.com/">thesawlady</a> on the first level, and a guy banging empty paint buckets and creating incredible percussion sound on the second level)

– Favorite book store: The Strand
