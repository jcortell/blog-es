Bush talking about AIDS

Bush singing _Imagine+Take a walk on the wild side_

Bush singing _Sunday Bloody Sunday_

Bush singing _Who‘s the Nigga_

Bush singing _Birthday PartyMix_

Bush singing about Drugs

(and more, like Kerry, Dick is a killer, Hillary, Xmas...)

My favourites? ALL! (but I like the rithm in My name is RX, and I love the Martin Luther King speech -except the God stuff-).
