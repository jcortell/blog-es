The current issue of IEEE Computer (Nov 07) has an article by Noel Sharkey about the move toward autonomous weapons.-  Excerpts below.

&#8220;Automated Killers and the Computing Professions
  
by Noel Sharkey, U. of Sheffield

&#8230;

&#8230; The U.S. has robots playing an integral part in its Future Combat Systems project, with spending estimated to exceed $230 B.-  &#8230; The U.S. military has &#8230; plans to develop unmanned vehicles that can strike from the air, under the sea, and on land.-  The U.S. Congress set a goal in 2001 for one-third of U.S. operational ground combat vehicles to be unmanned by 2015.-  More than 4000 robots currently serve in Iraq, with others deployed in Afghanistan.-  The U.S. military will spend $1.7 B on more ground-based robots over the next five years. &#8230;

These developments pose a moral and ethical minefield for engineers and computer scientists. &#8230;

To date, robots deployed in ground wars have been used mainly for ordinance disposal, such as clearing improvised explosive devices. This has saved lives.-  However, this summer the U.S. Army introduced the first three &#8230; SWORDS (Special Weapons Observation Reconniaissance Direct-Action System) armed combat robots into Iraq (http://www.foster-miller.com).-  These have been so effective that 80 more have been approved for use &#8230;

Semi-autonomous robots in the form of unmanned combat aerial vehicals (UCAVs) have also proven popular&#8230;

All these platforms currently work as extensions of the human fighters who control the application of lethal force.-  A human remains in the loop to decide when to kill.-  &#8230; But James Canton, CEO of Institute for Global Futures, predicts the deployment within a decade of detachments that will include 150 soldiers and 2000 robots. &#8230; With these ratios, the robots will need a lot more battlefield decision power.

&#8230;-  They enable a single battlefield soldier to initiate a large-scale robot attack from the air or on the ground.

&#8230;

This is dangerous new territory for warfare, yet there are no new ethical coldes or guidelines in place.

&#8230; Killer robots are coming soon and will not wait for us to solve all our AI problems.
